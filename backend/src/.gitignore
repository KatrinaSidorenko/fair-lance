# Go module cache
# This directory is where Go stores downloaded modules. It should generally not be committed.
# Depending on your setup, this might be in your user's home directory or inside your project.
# If it's within your project, you might want to exclude it.
# For example, if you're using `go mod vendor`, the `vendor/` directory is created.
